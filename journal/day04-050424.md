# Journal - Day 4 (05/04/24)


## Testing the Pipeline

1. Add the necessary files to your CodeCommit repository:

    `buildspec.yml`: This file defines the build steps for CodeBuild. It should include commands to install dependencies, run tests, and package your Lambda function code.
 
    `Lambda function code`: Add the source code files for your Lambda function (e.g., index.ts and any other required files) in the function/ directory.
    output-template.yaml: This file should contain the same content as the second CloudFormation template you provided. It defines your serverless architecture and will be used by CodePipeline to deploy the stack.

2. Push the files to the master branch of your CodeCommit repository.

3. Monitor the progress of your CodePipeline:
    
    Go to the AWS CodePipeline console and find your pipeline (named techtest-020424-pipeline based on your template).
    The pipeline should automatically start executing when you push changes to the master branch.
    Watch the progress of each stage (Source, Approval, Build, Deploy) to ensure they complete successfully.

4. Verify the deployment:
    
    After the pipeline completes successfully, go to the AWS CloudFormation console.
    Check if a new stack named techtest-020424-stack has been created or updated.
    Review the stack outputs to obtain the API Gateway endpoint URL and other relevant information.

5. Test the API:
   
    Use a tool like `cURL`, `Postman`, or a web browser to send requests to the API endpoints defined in your serverless architecture.
    Verify that the CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) on the /items and /items/{id} paths are working as expected.
    Check the DynamoDB table to ensure that data is being stored and retrieved correctly.



## Cloning Codecommit repo to Local

Currently I am using `admin`, cloning the CodeCommit repo using `HTTPS`, just for speed and simplicity of testing at the moment.

I will make this more secure with a specific IAM role assigned to a user, whose permissions are locked down more to simply being able to clone and commit to this specific repo.


### Testing Deployment
The `source` and `build` steps of the pipeline are passing fine, however I am running into issues with the apigateway stack needing `CAPABILITY_IAM` to actually create/update, and seemingly it is missing this.


I resolved this by making sure I had added all the capabilities in a comma-separated line.

## Successful Deployment.

At this stage, the deployment runs successfully. The API Gateway/Backend stack can be deployed as a standalone via SAM, or alternatively it can be updated when changes are pushed to the master branch.

I have tested using Postman manually again, and I am getting the correct responses. I still need to sort automated testing.

### Areas of Improvement
1. Make it so the `master` branch will not accept direct pushes, but rather trigger on merge into `master`.
2. Add a testing phase to the pipeline, making sure that the updates to the code don't cause breaking changes before deployment.
3. Update the templates to make them more parameterized, less hardcoded. Add relevant comments throughout.
4. Update application architectural diagrams (and general workflow diagrams) as clear visual aids.
5. Update the API Gateway/Backend Stack to be configured to be private.
6. Separate `dev/prod` environments. Configure `IAM Groups` and `IAM Users` (perhaps in a separate CloudFormation template) for each environment.

Before all of these steps, I will:
Review the security of the templates according to the Principle of Least Privilege.
