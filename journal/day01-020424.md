# Journal - Day 1 (02/04/24)

## Planning
I began the challenge by creating a plan based on the `technical-test.txt`, reviewing the information, and sorting the tasks into areas I would need to explore,  `NEW EXPERIENCE`, and areas I would need to recap, `DIRECT EXPERIENCE`.

I created multiple high-level design documents, including:
- Overview Application Architecture
- Mindmaps (Mermaid) 
- Sketch of API via OpenAPI spec, `openapi-3.0.yml`
- Initial creation of rough templates


## Next Steps (Plan for 03/04/24)
- Update application architecture to ensure outputs are carried over and referenced as `ImportValue`(s) in the CI/CD stack.
- Emphasis on creating using the Serverless Application Model `(SAM)`
- Devise and attempt to implement the `APIGW-Backend` Stack, which includes:
    - `Lambda Function` (needs compiling separately before deployment)
    - `DynamoDB Table`
    - `API Gateway REST API`
    - `Permissions Policies for Lambda to execute on DynamoDB`
