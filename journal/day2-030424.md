# Journal - Day 2 (03/04/24)
Began by reviewing the technical challenge brief and looking to amend the templates to make them more parameterized.

Updated the Kanban board.

Began testing the CloudFormation `APIGW-Backend` stack, using the `SAM` CLI commands in `BASH` scripts.

For the `package` stage of the overall `build-package-deploy` script using `SAM`, it is required to have an S3 bucket set up for the lambda to get packaged to.

Even though the command for making a bucket is simple:

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://<your-bucket-name>
```

I decided to make sure that it is parameterized using an environment variable and created using a script. This is because I want as much of the workflow to be able to be able to handle a simple environment variable change to say the 
```
S3_PACKAGED_LAMBDA_BUCKET_NAME
```
, and this will then update where the bucket is created.

The ideal architecture from a security perspective would of course be restricting the permissions for AWS users to create a bucket, and so there should be a lower risk of someone changing the bucket name and creating a different bucket for the packaged Lambda to go to.
